As I have sometimes had to check spelling of a word or sentence outside of a text editor I had a look around for a GUI for aspell but surprisingly couldn't find one! So I wrote this simple front end for ASpell just launch it from the accessories menu and paste or type a word in the text box and either press 'Spell Check' to check and correct all words in the text box or select a single word and press 'Check Word' to just correct that one, that's all there is to it.
